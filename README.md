# FirefoxMinimalCSS
## A minimal userChrome.css configuration for Firefox

This is a collection of CSS files that modify the UI of Firefox. The modifications hide tabs bar and url bar by default, but they still can be activated via shortcuts or mouse hover. These modifications do help you save vertical screen real-estate and synergize well with "Tree Style Tab" extension that enables you to show tabs in Firefox's native sidebar in a columnar tree view.

# Issues
* When firefox displays an alert strip from the top up complaining about how a pop-up windows should be opened, this strip is partially cut off from the window top.
